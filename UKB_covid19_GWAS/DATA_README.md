# COVID-19 UKB GWAS Dataset release from the Rivas Lab

We make our dataset publicly available via Google Drive shared folder: https://bit.ly/rivas-lab_covid19_UKB_GWAS . Given that we will be continuously updating our analysis, we use an explicit versioning of our data release and the release date is indicated by directory name (`YYYYMMDD`).

This document explains the set of availalbe files. Please check [`README.md`](README.md) for a summary of our analysis.

We used [plink2](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/) for our GWAS analysis. Please check the [plink file format description](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/formats#glm_logistic).

## Version `20200422`

- We included the X-chromosome association statistics for files with `BMI_Townsend` in its file name.
